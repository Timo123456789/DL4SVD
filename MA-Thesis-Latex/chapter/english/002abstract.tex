\section*{Abstract}
The precise detection and classification of small vehicles in high-resolution remote sensing data is essential for applications such as traffic monitoring and urban planning.
The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of additional spectral channels on object detection performance. Experiments on multispectral aerial images show the that infrared channel improve the detection accuracy of small vehicles, while vegetation indices such as NDVI are not consistently beneficial. RGB data alone already provides solid results, with the availability of extensive training data having the greatest impact on model performance. \acrshort{YOLO}v9 proves to be particularly suitable for small objects. The results confirm the potential of deep learning methods for vehicle detection in multispectral remote sensing data and open up perspectives for further research, for example on the use of multitemporal data or scaling effects.
