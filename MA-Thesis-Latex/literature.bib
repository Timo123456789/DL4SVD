   abstract = {Airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was assessed as a potential tool to locate single grave sites. While airborne HSI has shown to be useful to locate mass graves, it is expected the location of single graves would be an order of magnitude more difficult due to the smaller size and reduced mass of the targets. Two clearings were evaluated (through a blind test) as potential sites for containing at least one set of buried remains. At no time prior to submitting the locations of the potential burial sites from the HSI were the actual locations of the sites released or shared with anyone from the analysis team.The two HSI sensors onboard the aircraft span the range of 408-2524. nm. A range of indicators that exploit the narrow spectral and spatial resolutions of the two complimentary HSI sensors onboard the aircraft were calculated. Based on the co-occurrence of anomalous pixels within the expected range of the indicators three potential areas conforming to our underlying assumptions of the expected spectral responses (and spatial area) were determined. After submission of the predicted burial locations it was revealed that two of the targets were located within GPS error (10. m) of the true burial locations. Furthermore, due to the history of the TPOF site for burial work, investigation of the third target is being considered in the near future. The results clearly demonstrate promise for hyperspectral imaging to aid in the detection of buried remains, however further work is required before these results can justifiably be used in routine scenarios.},

   abstract = {This study evaluates and compares the performance of four machine learning classifiers—support vector machine (SVM), normal Bayes (NB), classification and regression tree (CART) and K nearest neighbor (KNN)—to classify very high resolution images, using an object-based classification procedure. In particular, we investigated how tuning parameters affect the classification accuracy with different training sample sizes. We found that: (1) SVM and NB were superior to CART and KNN, and both could achieve high classification accuracy (>90%); (2) the setting of tuning parameters greatly affected classification accuracy, particularly for the most commonly-used SVM classifier; the optimal values of tuning parameters might vary slightly with the size of training samples;  (3) the size of training sample also greatly affected the classification accuracy, when the size of training sample was less than 125. Increasing the size of training samples generally led to the increase of classification accuracies for all four classifiers. In addition, NB and KNN were more sensitive to the sample sizes. This research provides insights into the selection of classifiers and the size of training samples. It also highlights the importance of the appropriate setting of tuning parameters for different machine learning classifiers and provides useful information for optimizing these parameters.},

   abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence is seeing the increased application of satellite imagery to analyse poverty in its various manifestations. This nascent but rapidly growing intersection of scholarship holds the potential to help us better understand poverty by leveraging big data and recent advances in machine vision. In this study, we statistically analyse the literature in the expanding field of welfare and poverty predictions from the combination of machine learning and satellite imagery. Here, we apply an integrative review method to extract key data on factors related to the predictive power of welfare. We found that the most important factors correlated to the predictive power of welfare are the number of pre-processing steps employed, the number of datasets used, the type of welfare indicator targeted and the choice of AI model. Studies that used stock measure indicators (assets) as targets achieved better performance—17 percentage points higher—in predicting welfare than those that targeted flow measures (income and consumption) ones. Additionally, we found that the combination of machine learning and deep learning significantly increases predictive power—by as much as 15 percentage points—compared to using either alone. Surprisingly, we found that the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used is important but not critical to the performance as the relationship is positive but not statistically significant. These findings have important implications for future research in this domain and for anyone aspiring to use the methodology.},

The method is based on a translation of the visual characterization of the searched structures into a morphological image processing chain. Two variants are described: the first variant extracts dwellings fully automatic for enumeration, while the second links the area covered by dwellings to visual interpretation results of representative samples for estimation of the total number of dwellings. Compared to the visual interpretation both produce similar results with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.66 respectively leading to a mean error of 6% in the total number of dwellings. In complex camp settings, the area-based approach might be preferred, since it provides some more control due to the visual interpretation included.

The object-oriented approach can contribute to powerful automatic and semi-automatic analysis for most remote sensing applications. Synergetic use to pixel-based or statistical signal processing methods explores the rich information contents. Here, we explain principal strategies of object-oriented analysis, discuss how the combination with fuzzy methods allows implementing expert knowledge and describe a representative example for the proposed workflow from remote sensing imagery to GIS. The strategies are demonstrated using the first object-oriented image analysis software on the market, eCognition, which provides an appropriate link between remote sensing imagery and GIS. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Such data reveal vegetation canopies in high spatial detail. Efficient methods are needed to fully harness this unpreceded source of information for vegetation mapping. Deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are currently paving new avenues in the field of image analysis and computer vision. Using multiple datasets, we test a CNN-based segmentation approach (U-net) in combination with training data directly derived from visual interpretation of UAV-based high-resolution RGB imagery for fine-grained mapping of vegetation species and communities. We demonstrate that this approach indeed accurately segments and maps vegetation species and communities (at least 84% accuracy). The fact that we only used RGB imagery suggests that plant identification at very high spatial resolutions is facilitated through spatial patterns rather than spectral information. Accordingly, the presented approach is compatible with low-cost UAV systems that are easy to operate and thus applicable to a wide range of users.},

   abstract = {Satellite imagery is changing the way we understand and predict economic activity in the world. Advancements in satellite hardware and low-cost rocket launches have enabled near-real-time, high-resolution images covering the entire Earth. It is too labour-intensive, time-consuming and expensive for human annotators to analyse petabytes of satellite imagery manually. Current computer vision research exploring this problem still lack accuracy and prediction speed, both significantly important metrics for latency-sensitive automatized industrial applications. Here we address both of these challenges by proposing a set of improvements to the object recognition model design, training and complexity regularisation, applicable to a range of neural networks. Furthermore, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) architecture optimised for accurate and accelerated object recognition in multispectral satellite imagery. We show that our FCN exceeds human-level performance with state-of-the-art 97.67% accuracy over multiple sensors, it is able to generalize across dispersed scenery and outperforms other proposed methods to date. Its computationally light architecture delivers a fivefold improvement in training time and a rapid prediction, essential to real-time applications. To illustrate practical model effectiveness, we analyse it in algorithmic trading environment. Additionally, we publish a proprietary annotated satellite imagery dataset for further development in this research field. Our findings can be readily implemented for other real-time applications too.},

   abstract = {The fundamental goal of machine learning (ML) is to inculcate computers to use data or former practice to resolve a specified problem. Artificial intelligence has given us incredible web search, self-driving vehicles, practical speech affirmation, and a massively better cognizance of human genetic data. An exact range of effective programs of ML already exist, which comprises classifiers to swot e-mail messages to study that allows distinguishing between unsolicited mail and non-spam messages. ML can be implemented as class analysis over supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised ML (SML) is the subordinate branch of ML and habitually counts on a domain skilled expert who "teaches" the learning scheme with required supervision. It also generates a task that maps inputs to chosen outputs. SML is genuinely normal in characterization issues since the aim is to get the computer, familiar with created descriptive framework. The data annotation is termed as a training set and the testing set as unannotated data. When annotations are discrete in the value, they are called class labels and continuous numerical annotations as continuous target values. The objective of SML is to form a compact prototype of the distribution of class labels in terms of predictor types. The resultant classifier is then used to designate class labels to the testing sets where the estimations of the predictor types are known, yet the values of the class labels are unidentified. Under certain assumptions, the larger the size of the training set, the better the expectations on the test set. This motivates the requirement for numerous area specialists or even different non-specialists giving names to preparing the framework. SML problems are grouped into classification and regression. In Classification the result has discrete value and the aim is to predict the discrete values fitting to a specific class. Regression is acquired from the Labeled Datasets and continuous-valued result are predicted for the latest data which is given to the algorithm. When choosing an SML algorithm, the heterogeneity, precision, excess, and linearity of the information ought to be examined before selecting an algorithm. SML is used in a various range of applications such as speech and object recognition, bioinformatics, and spam detection. Recently, advances in SML are being witnessed in solid-state material science for calculating material properties and predicting their structure. This review covers various algorithms and real-world applications of SML. The key advantage of SML is that, once an algorithm swots with data, it can do its task automatically.},
